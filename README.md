## How it Works ?
1. Explaining the working of project
  Our app uses firebase as backend. First we authenticate the user using firebase mobile auth.
  User have to enter his name and basic details. User can scan Qr code of the shop owner and
  his visit will be registered in database. Shop owner can generate Qr code, view  visited 
  customers and their details. He can also see customer statics.
